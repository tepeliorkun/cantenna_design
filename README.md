# CST Studio Suite - 2.45 GHz Cantenna Simulation

This project contains the complete 3D simulation of a cylindrical waveguide antenna (cantenna) designed for the 2.4–2.5 GHz ISM band using CST Studio Suite 2024 (Student Edition). The antenna structure operates in the dominant **TE₁₁ mode**, and the geometry is optimized for maximum directivity and impedance matching.

## Highlights
- **Target Frequency**: 2.45 GHz
- **Waveguide Diameter**: 80 mm
- **Waveguide Length**: 186 mm
- **Feed Type**: Monopole probe excitation
- **Operating Mode**: TE₁₁
- **Directivity**: 8.05 dBi
- **S11**: ~ -20 dB at 2.4 GHz
- **Simulation Method**: Time domain solver

## Simulation Outputs
- Electric field distribution (Bubbles/Abs animated as `.gif`)
- Farfield pattern at 2.45 GHz
- S-parameter plot (|S₁₁|)
- Transparent geometry view with excitation probe
